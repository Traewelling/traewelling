# Developing and contributing

We want you to know that Träwelling is a hobby project, developed and maintained by a team of volunteers in their spare
time.
We do our best to address issues and improve the platform, but please be aware that we may not always be able to respond
to requests immediately.
However, we welcome anyone who wants to contribute to the project!
If you find a bug or have an idea for a new feature, please feel free to open an issue / discussion on GitHub.
We also encourage you to help us by fixing bugs and implementing new features yourself.

When submitting a pull request, please keep it small and focused, and open multiple pull requests if necessary to make
the review process smoother and faster.
Thank you for your support as we work together to make Träwelling the best it can be!

If you are adding code:

* If you are editing the language files, please check that your change will work in at least English.

* If you are working on the front page (see screenshot above), please consider updating the screenshot.

* Please consider adding unit and integration tests, especially if you're adding new features.
