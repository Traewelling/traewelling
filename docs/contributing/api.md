## API Guidelines

Even though this has not really been implemented yet, we would refer to the
[Zalando's API guidelines](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/)
for future changes and new endpoints.

## API documentation

The API documentation is available at `/api/documentation`.

API documentation can be generated by running `php artisan l5-swagger:generate`.

It is recommended that you set the environment variable `L5_SWAGGER_GENERATE_ALWAYS=true` in your local `.env` file to
always generate the API documentation on every request.
