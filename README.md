# [Tr√§welling](https://traewelling.de)

> Tr√§welling is a free check-in service that lets you tell your friends where you are and where you can log your public transit journeys. In short, you can check into trains and get points for it. Check it out at [traewelling.de](https://traewelling.de).

## Set up an instance

To set up a Tr√§welling instance you'll need:
* [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
* [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/download) (SQLite is used for running tests)
* A local instance of [db-rest v5](https://github.com/derhuerst/db-rest/tree/5)
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
* PHP 8.0 (or higher) and the following extensions:
  * gd
  * sodium
  * exif
  * pdo_mysql
  * pdo_sqlite
	
After setting up these, you can clone the repository and install the project's dependencies:

```sh
composer install
npm install
```

Now, you can create your own environment configuration:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
vi .env
```

Please change whatever sounds wrong to you. This is also the place to add API keys (e.g. for Twitter). While you will
not need all of those, you can stumble into weird bugs.

Then, generate some application keys and migrate the database to the latest level:

```sh
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate 
#for example data use 
#php artisan db:seed
php artisan passport:install
```

Last, but not least, you can run `npm run dev` to build the frontend and watch for changes in the `resources/` folder.

Use your webserver of choice or the in php included dev server (`php artisan serve`) to boot the application. You should see the Tr√§welling
homepage at http://localhost:8000.

## Contributing

Contributions are more than welcome. Please open an issue for bugs or feature requests. If you want to implement the
feature - great; if you don't want to, that's fine, too.

If you add code:

* If you edit the language files, please check if your change is applicable at least in german.
  
* If you work on the front page (see screenshot above), please consider updating the screenshot.
  
* Unless you really want to work on Tr√§welling for a long time, we cannot support more languages. It would be sad to
  have half-baked languages that have missing strings after a while.
  
* Please consider adding unit and integration tests, especially if you're adding new features.

### Translations

We currently support the languages German, English, Polish, French and Dutch. We would like to become even more
international and for this we need you and your language skills.

We use a [Weblate instance](https://weblate.bubu1.eu/projects/trawelling/) to manage the translations. There you can add
new translations and correct mistakes.

## License

We are using the [Affero General Public License](/LICENSE) ([why?](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-affero-gpl)) - you
are required to publish changes that you make to this software. Please refrain from creating your own public instance of
Tr√§welling, instead try to create a better version for everyone.
