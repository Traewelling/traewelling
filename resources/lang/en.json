Afterwards the base points are added.<br />An ICE journey of 143km thus earns you <code>10 + round up(143/10) = 10 + 15 = 25</code>&nbsp;Points, for an S-Bahn journey of 8km you get <code>2 + round up(8/10) = 2 + 1 = 3</code>&nbsp;Points.<br />We want you to check in as soon as possible so that the platform always has an up-to-date status of your journeys. reasonTherefore, you will only receive full points if you check in during your journey or 20min before live departure (scheduled departure + delay). If you check in 1h before or after the travel period, you can still get 1/4 of the points. If you check in earlier or later on a connection, you will receive the full kilometres and hours, but only one pity point.",
