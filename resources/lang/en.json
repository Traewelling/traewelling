Afterwards the base points are added.<br/>10 + round up(143/10) = 10 + 15 = 25</code> &nbsp;points, for a S-Bahn trip of 8km there is <code>2 + round up(8/10) = 2 + 1 = 3</code>&nbsp;points.<br />We want you to keep Träwelling on track with your journeys. For that reason, you only receive the whole amount of points, if you check-in during the journey or 20min before you leave (scheduled departure and live-delay, according to Deutsche Bahn). When you check-in within 1 hour before or after the itinerary, you can still get a quarter of the points. However, if you check-in even earlier or later, you will only get one compassion point.",
