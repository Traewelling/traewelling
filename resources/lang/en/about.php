    // Wir möchten, dass Du möglichst zeitnah eincheckst, damit die Plattform immer einen aktuellen Stand Deiner Reisen hat. Darum gibt es die vollen Punkte nur, wenn Du während Deiner Reise oder 20min vor Live-Abfahrt (Plan-Abfahrt + Verspätung) eincheckst. Wer 1h vor oder nach dem Reisezeitraum eincheckt, bekommt immerhin noch 1/4 der Punkte. Wenn Du noch früher oder später in eine Verbindung eincheckst, bekommst Du die vollen Kilometer und Stunden gutgeschrieben, aber nur einen Mitleidspunkt.

For that reason, you only receive the whole amount of points, if you check-in during the journey or 20min before you leave (scheduled departure and live-delay, according to Deutsche Bahn). When you check-in within 1 hour before or after the itinerary, you can still get a quarter of the points. However, if you check-in even earlier or later, you will only get one compassion point.",
