## Cookies

Our website uses cookies. These are small text files that your web browser stores on your device. Cookies help us to make our site more user-friendly, effective and secure.

Some cookies are "session cookies." Such cookies are deleted automatically at the end of your browser session. However, other cookies remain on your end device until you delete them yourself. Such cookies help us to recognize you when you return to our website.

With a modern web browser you can monitor, restrict or prevent the use of cookies. Many web browsers can be configured so that cookies are deleted automatically when the program is closed. The deactivation of cookies can result in a limited functionality of our website.

The placement of cookies, which are necessary for the exercise of electronic communication processes or the provision of certain functions requested by you (e.g. shopping cart), takes place on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. As the operator of this website, we have a legitimate interest in the storage of cookies for the technically error-free and smooth provision of our services. If other cookies are set (e.g. for analysis functions), these are described separately in this data protection declaration.

## Transferring Data to third party services

Since the central function of Träwelling is to provide data published on Träwelling on other social networks, all travel data (check-ins) are automatically forwarded to the service provider selected by the user (Mastodon and/or Twitter) and published there.
In addition, Träwelling passes on personal data to authorities, other government agencies or private individuals if there is an obligation to do so on the basis of statutory provisions, court decisions or official orders.
Träwelling may entrust third parties with the collection, storage and use of personal data (processing commission). In this case Träwelling remains the responsible body. These third parties are subject to the same data protection regulations as Träwelling.

## Social Single Sign On

"Social Single Sign-On" are processes that allow users to use the information that they gave to one service to register and login to our service. The prerequisite for this is that the users are registered with the respective provider and are already registered with the single sign-on provider and confirm the single sign-on via a button.

Authentication takes place directly with the respective single sign-on provider. Within the scope of such authentication, we receive a user ID with the information that the user is registered with the respective provider under this user ID and an ID that cannot be used for other purposes (so-called "user handle"), together with tokens, which enable us to publish, read, manipulate and delete status in the respective social network. Whether additional data is transmitted to us depends on the single sign-on procedure used, on the data releases selected during authentication and also on privacy settings of the user account at the single sign-on provider. Depending on the single sign-on provider and the user's choice, it can be different data, usually the e-mail address and the user name. The password entered by the provider as part of the single sign-on procedure is neither visible to us nor is it stored by us.

Users are requested to note that the data deposited with us can be automatically compared with their user account with the single sign-on provider, but this is not always the case. If, for example, the e-mail addresses of users change, they must change these manually in their user account with us.

We can use the Single Sign-On registration, if agreed with the users, in the context of or before the fulfilment of the contract, if the users were asked for it, in the context of a consent process and use it otherwise on the basis of the legitimate interests on our part and the interests of the users in an effective and secure registration system.

If users decide that they no longer wish to use the Single Sign-On provider's link for the Single Sign-On procedure, they must remove the link within their Single Sign-On provider's user account and in their settings on our site. If user wishes to delete their data with us, they must cancel their registration with us.
